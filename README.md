## Features

- **Scale Percentage Calculator**: Calculate the exact scaling percentage needed for your 3D prints
- **Real-world to Model Conversion**: Convert actual object dimensions to scaled model dimensions
- **Reverse Scale Calculator**: Determine what scale percentage you need to achieve a specific model size
- **Intuitive Interface**: Easy-to-use tool designed for makers and 3D printing enthusiasts

## Use Cases

- Scaling architectural models to fit your print bed
- Creating miniatures at specific scales (1:64, 1:87, etc.)
- Resizing objects to match existing model collections
- Calculating material requirements for scaled prints
- Converting between different measurement units
